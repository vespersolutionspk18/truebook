# Code Review Audit

This document contains a log of all the findings from the code review of the application.

## Security

### `middleware.ts`

- **[OK]** The middleware correctly checks for a session token and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. It also redirects authenticated users from the login page to the dashboard. This is a good security practice.

### `app/api/register/route.ts`

- **[OK]** The registration route uses `bcrypt` to hash passwords, which is a good security practice. It also checks if a user with the given email already exists.

### `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

- **[OK]** The NextAuth configuration seems secure. It uses the Prisma adapter, JWT for sessions, and a credentials provider with bcrypt for password comparison. The cookies are configured with `httpOnly` and `secure` in production, which is good.
- **[Suggestion]** The `console.log` statements should be removed in a production environment.

### API Routes

- **`app/api/generate/route.ts`:** This file is empty and doesn't contain any code.
- **`app/api/integrations/monroney/callback/route.ts`:** This route handles the OAuth callback from Monroney. It correctly exchanges the authorization code for an access token and stores it in the database. It also uses a `code_verifier` for PKCE, which is a good security practice. The use of `redirect` for error handling is appropriate.
- **`app/api/integrations/monroney/init/route.ts`:** This route initializes the Monroney OAuth flow. It generates a PKCE challenge and stores the verifier in a secure, httpOnly cookie. This is a secure way to handle the OAuth flow.
- **`app/api/monroney/route.ts`:** This route fetches all Monroney labels from the database. It has proper error handling and returns a 404 if no labels are found.
- **`app/api/monroney/[vin]/route.ts`:** This route retrieves a Monroney PDF from the `public` directory based on the VIN. It includes checks for the existence of the file and proper error handling. However, it's worth noting that this approach of storing and serving files directly from the filesystem might not be scalable for a large number of files. A dedicated file storage service like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage would be a better solution in the long run.
- **`app/api/monroney/save/route.ts`:** This route saves Monroney data to the database. It includes authorization checks, data validation, and proper error handling, including specific Prisma error codes.
- **`app/api/user/settings/route.ts`:** This route handles user settings. It correctly fetches and updates user settings, including password changes with bcrypt. It also has good error handling.
- **`app/api/vehicles/route.ts`:** This route handles fetching and creating vehicles. It includes authorization checks, data validation, and a transaction to ensure data integrity when creating a vehicle.
- **`app/api/vehicles/[uuid]/route.ts`:** This route handles fetching and deleting a specific vehicle. It includes authorization checks to ensure that only the owner of the vehicle can access or delete it.
- **`app/api/vehicles/check/[vin]/route.ts`:** This route checks if a vehicle with a given VIN already exists for the current user. It includes proper authorization checks.

## Best Practices & Performance

### `next.config.ts`

- **[OK]** The `next.config.ts` file includes a webpack configuration that adds a rule to handle `.html` files from `node-pre-gyp` with `null-loader`. This is a workaround for a known issue with `node-pre-gyp` and webpack, and it's an acceptable solution.

### `package.json`

- **[OK]** The `package.json` file shows a typical Next.js project with a good set of dependencies for building a modern web application. There are no obviously outdated or unnecessary dependencies. The use of `@hookform/resolvers` with `zod` for form validation is a good choice.

## Code Quality & Maintainability

### `components` directory

- **[OK]** The code in the `components` directory is well-structured and follows best practices for building a React application with Next.js. The use of `shadcn/ui` provides a solid foundation for the UI, and the components are well-organized and easy to understand.

### `lib` directory

- **[OK]** The `lib` directory contains utility functions and the database client, which is a good separation of concerns. The code is well-written and easy to understand.
- **[CRITICAL]** The `lib/gemini-monroney.ts` file has a hardcoded API key. This is a major security vulnerability. This key should be moved to an environment variable and should not be committed to the repository.
